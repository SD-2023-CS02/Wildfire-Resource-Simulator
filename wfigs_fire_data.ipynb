    "| SecondaryFuelModel | The fuel model which best represents the secondary carrier of the fire for the reporting period. |\n",
    "| TotalIncidentPersonnel | The total number of personnel assigned. Includes overhead, crewmembers, helicopter crewmember, engine crewmembers, camp crew people, etc. |\n",
    "| UniqueFireIdentifier | Unique identifier assigned to each wildland fire.  yyyy = calendar year, SSUUUU = POO protecting unit identifier (5 or 6 characters), xxxxxx = local incident identifier (6 to 10 characters)  |\n",
    "| WFDSSDecisionStatus | Indicates the state of the WFDSS decision and/or if a WFDSS decision has been approved for the incident. This information is helpful in resolving conflicts between incident records. |\n",
    "| OrganizationalAssessment | The Organizational Assessment is part of the Wildland Fire Risk and Complexity Assessment (RCA) that was implemented by NWCG in January 2014, which guides Agency Administrators in their management organization selection, both in escalating and moderating situations.  The Organizational Assessment can be compared with the current Incident Management Organization and many other incident level data elements over the life of the fire. It may not always match the current Incident Management Organization value. The authority for producing the Organizational Assessment lies with the incident commander (NWCG PMS-210), thus, the Organizational Assessment can change independent of the published decision.  |\n",
    "| StrategicDecisionPublishDate | The Decision Publish Date represents the date Agency Administrators published (approved) the Strategic Decision document. New decisions can be created and published at any time until the incident has been called out. |\n",

    "| CpxName | The Incident Name of the Complex that is the parent of the incident. |\n",
    "| CpxID | The IRWIN ID for the Complex record that is the parent of the incident. |\n",
